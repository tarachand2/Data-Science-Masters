Databases can be used for a wide range of applications, including e-commerce, customer relationship management, inventory management, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of databases, with different approaches to storing and accessing data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SQL databases (Structured Query Language)** are relational databases that use a table-based data storage system. They store data in tables with a fixed number of columns, and each row in a table represents a unique record. SQL databases use a standard language, called SQL, to retrieve data from the tables using complex queries. They are commonly used for applications that require complex joins, transactions, and structured data. Examples of SQL databases include Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **NoSQL databases**, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that use a variety of data models for storing data. They do not use tables, and each record can have a different structure, making them more flexible than SQL databases. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, and they can scale horizontally across multiple servers. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase."

    "Primary Key and Foreign Key are two important concepts in database design that are used to establish relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Primary Key**: A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. This means that no two rows in the table can have the same primary key value. Primary keys are used to enforce data integrity and to establish relationships between tables. Typically, a primary key is created using an auto-incrementing integer column, but it can also be created using a combination of columns if no single column can uniquely identify each row. For example, in a table of customers, the \"id\" column could be used as the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Foreign Key**: A foreign key is a column in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. This is used to establish relationships between tables, where the foreign key column in one table is linked to the primary key column in another table. The foreign key column in the child table is used to maintain referential integrity, which ensures that the data in the child table remains consistent with the data in the parent table. For example, in a table of orders, the \"customer_id\" column could be a foreign key that references the \"id\" column in the customers table."
