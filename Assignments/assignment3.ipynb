    "\n",
    "    1. Ordered: Tuples maintain the order of their elements. This means that the first element in a tuple will always be the \n",
    "                first element, the second element will always be the second, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Immutable: Tuples are immutable, which means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified or deleted. \n",
