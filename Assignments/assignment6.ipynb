    "1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the internal workings of an object from the outside world, and only exposing a public interface that can be used to interact with the object. This helps to ensure that the object is used correctly and consistently, and can prevent unintended changes to the object's internal state.\n",

    "3. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism means having multiple forms. In OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are objects of a common superclass. This allows us to write code that can work with objects of different types, without needing to know the specific type of each object.\n",

In OOP, abstraction is achieved by defining classes that represent concepts or entities in the problem domain, and hiding unnecessary details from the outside world.
